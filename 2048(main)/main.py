Transition: A Transition shows how a board transfromed from a state to the next state. It contains the board state (s), the action performed (a), 
the reward received by performing the action (r), the board's "after state" after applying the action (s_after), and the board's "next state" (s_next) after adding a random tile to the "after state".

Gameplay: A series of transitions on the board (transition_history). Also reports the total reward of playing the game (game_reward) and the maximum tile reached (max_tile).
